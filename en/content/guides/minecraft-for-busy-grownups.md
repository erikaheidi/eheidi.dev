Whether or not you have kids, there is a high chance you have heard about Minecraft. The pixelated look with characters made out of blocks became an iconic brand that most people recognize even if they have never played the game before.

Minecraft was originally released in 2011 by Mojang Studios, with Microsoft buying the brand later on in 2014. It has since become the [best-selling video game of all time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_video_games), with over 300 million copies sold. Often cited as one of the greatest video games ever created, Minecraft is also often used in [educational environments](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecraft-in-education-how-video-games-are-teaching-kids/1100-6400549/) as a tool to teach geography, chemistry, programming, among other subjects. There's even a [movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Minecraft_Movie) to be released next year!

There are many different ways in which you can play Minecraft, but overall, Minecraft is a lovely game to play online with friends and family. In this straightforward guide, I will share what I learned as a newbie parent gamer setting up Minecraft worlds to play with my daughter and her friends. I won't go into too many details about how to play the game, just enough so that you can start building and exploring your Minecraft worlds.

## TL;DR
- There are two main versions of Minecraft: Bedrock and Java. Bedrock runs on consoles and on Windows systems, while Java runs on macOS, Linux, and Windows. These are not compatible with each other, so you have to choose depending on your available devices. Bedrock is the most versatile and multi-platform.
- You'll need to buy Minecraft, either from their website (for PC) or from your game console digital store (PlayStation, Nintendo Switch, Xbox…). On Windows, it is possible to play both Java and Bedrock.
- Playing with remote friends in a shared world requires a Minecraft server or a Minecraft Realm. Setting up a server can be lots of work, but more folks can join. Realms are managed instances with a limited number of concurrent players (up to 11), they are easy to set up and require no maintenance. There are Realms for Java and for Bedrock.


## Preparation and Install

To play Minecraft with friends and family, you will need:

* A [Microsoft](https://signup.live.com) account;
* A suitable device that is compatible with the version of Minecraft your friends are playing;
* The Minecraft software. If playing on a PC, you'll need to purchase [Minecraft Java & Bedrock PC edition](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/store/minecraft-java-bedrock-edition-pc). If playing from a console such as Nintendo Switch, Xbox, or PlayStation, you'll need to purchase the game from your console digital store.


For people used to working on a PC daily, it might be easier to play the PC version, using your keyboard and mouse. I personally prefer that over playing with a controller. My daughter, on the other hand, finds it easier to play with the controller, since she is not used to keyboard and mouse operation.

One thing a lot of people don't realize is that there are different versions of the Minecraft software, and they are not compatible with all devices. The original is the Java version, which is the only version compatible with Linux and macOS systems. The Java version has limitations, but if you don't have a Windows machine you can roll with that one (in this case, everybody else in the group must use the Java version too).

The Bedrock edition runs on consoles and also on Windows computers. This version is the most widely compatible version of Minecraft at the moment, since folks can join from Nintendo Switch, PlayStation, Xbox, and also from a Windows PC.

### Minecraft Compatibility Matrix

Before opting for a platform, it's good to know which platform your friends are playing on, so that you can make sure you're purchasing a compatible version. Overall, Bedrock is preferred, since it is compatible with more platforms, but that will require you to use Windows if you're playing on a PC. I haven't tried running Minecraft from a virtual machine, so I do not know if that is possible at all. Here at home, I play on an older Windows notebook, while my daughter plays on her Nintendo Switch.

|  | Windows | Linux / macOS | Consoles |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Windows** | Java and Bedrock | Java only | Bedrock only |
| **Linux / macOS** | Java only | Java only | X |
| **Consoles** | Bedrock only | X | Bedrock only |

## Understanding Minecraft Worlds, Servers, and Realms

The first thing you need to understand about the Minecraft experience is that the game happens in a sandbox world, and you can have several worlds with different patches and mods applied. Mods can change the basic gameplay and introduce different animals, textures, and functionalities.

Worlds can be played offline, but it's not all that much fun to play by yourself. To be able to invite friends over to your world so that you can play in a private, shared environment, you'll need either a Minecraft Server or a Minecraft Realm.

### Playing with Friends

To play with friends in a shared world, you'll need a Minecraft Server or a Realm. The Minecraft server software is available for both [Java](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server) and [Bedrock](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server/bedrock) editions. Be aware that running and managing your own server has costs and can be lots of work\! [This tutorial on DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-minecraft-server-on-ubuntu-22-04) explains in detail how to install the  Java server and get it up and running on a Linux VPS.

For those who don't want to deal with servers and maintenance, [Minecraft Realms](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/realms) can be just the perfect solution – these are managed instances where you can play with up to 10 friends simultaneously, upon invitation. At a monthly cost of $3.99 for 3 simultaneous players (you \+ 2 players) and $7.99 for 11 simultaneous players (you \+ 10 players), this option is usually still cheaper than paying for a remote server and getting it set up on your own. Be aware that there are two different versions of Realms, one for Bedrock (Minecraft Realms and Realms Plus) and one for Java (Minecraft Java Realms), so make sure to choose a version compatible with your devices if you are subscribing to this service.

Lastly, there are public servers where you can play with people from all over the internet. Naturally, these are not under your control, so you have to choose a server very carefully if you're playing with your kids. [This site](https://findmcserver.com/) has the official Minecraft server list presented by Gamersafer, where servers are classified and identified with badges so you can find a suitable server more easily.

## Getting Started

When playing on a PC, you'll open the **Minecraft Launcher** in order to start the game. The first time you click on the green "PLAY" button on the top, it will download the game to your computer. The launcher detects your operating system and will only allow you to run compatible versions of the game.

When the download is complete, the game will launch in a new window.

### Minecraft Bedrock Edition

![Initial screen Minecraft Bedrock Edition](https://cdn.erikaheidi.com/minecraft/01-initial-screen.png)
Bedrock edition runs on consoles and also on Windows systems. One of the main differences between Bedrock and Java is that on Bedrock you have access to the [Minecraft Marketplace](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/catalog), where you can get customizations for your character and for your Minecraft worlds. After signing in with your Microsoft account, you'll be able to change the appearance of your character and also edit your profile on Minecraft, directly from the game interface.

![Minecraft marketplace for Bedrock edition](https://cdn.erikaheidi.com/minecraft/04-marketplace.png)

### Minecraft Java Edition

![Initial Screen Minecraft Java Edition](https://cdn.erikaheidi.com/minecraft/01-java.png)

The Java edition opens in a screen where you can choose between Singleplayer or Multiplayer modes, and there's another option to access Minecraft Java Realms. The multiplayer mode allows you to connect to Minecraft servers both remotely and also on your local network. To be honest, I haven't tried to connect to a remote server as I did not know any, and also because I wouldn't be able to play with my daughter anyway, since she is playing on the Switch (Bedrock edition). You can definitely [install your own Minecraft server](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-minecraft-server-on-ubuntu-22-04) and invite your friends, but only folks playing the Java version will be able to join. If you don't want to manage a whole server on your own, you can also subscribe to Minecraft Java Realms and create a realm there for a fee. Again, only folks playing the Java version will be able to join, so think it through before you spend money on a Minecraft Java Realm.

## Minecraft Game Modes

As mentioned briefly in the introduction, Minecraft has essentially 3 different modes in which you can play with friends. The mode is set for a world as a whole, so everyone playing in that world will be subject to the same type of gameplay.

### Survival Mode

![creepers in a cavern](https://cdn.erikaheidi.com/minecraft/mobs.jpg)

This is the classic, default mode of playing Minecraft. In survival mode, you have to mine blocks to build everything from scratch – including tools. You can choose from 4 different difficulty levels: peaceful, easy, normal, and hard. In survival mode, hostile [mobs](https://beebom.com/minecraft-mobs-complete-list/) will spawn at night, and they can hurt you and destroy your buildings. You also need to eat food, otherwise you'll starve to death.

If you want the excitement of mining and building your world from scratch but don't want to deal with mobs and food, you can choose "Peaceful" mode, and nothing will harm you. You can still get hurt in other ways, like falling from a high, but mobs won't spawn at night, and you don't need to eat. This is an excellent way to get started and learn how to play the game, how to build your tools, and where to find resources. I definitely recommend Peaceful Survival mode for anyone who is starting, and also for those who prefer a more chill gameplay.

### Creative Mode

In this mode, you don't need to mine or build things, because you'll have infinite resources directly available from your inventory. You can also fly, which makes things a lot easier for building. This mode is good for building big worlds and creating experiences for other users, or to simply build grand things without having to collect all the materials you'd normally need.

I confess that I started playing creative mode because I was too lazy, but I quickly became bored, because there was no goal or progression. Nowadays, I prefer Peaceful Survival mode, where I still get all the excitement of mining new materials and building things from scratch, without the annoyance of hostile mobs.

### Adventure Mode

In Adventure mode, you don't build or mine anything; this is a special mode that allow users to experience Minecraft in a more storytelling way. In this mode you can still take damage, and you can interact with redstone mechanisms and also trade with villagers. These features are often leveraged by users to build worlds with custom experiences and mini-games. Many of these worlds can be found at the [Minecraft Marketplace](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/catalog) under "Adventure Maps".

## Playing the Game
Enough talking, now let's see the basics about how to play Minecraft.

### Character Customization

Before you start playing, you may want to customize your character. On Bedrock edition, you can do so directly from the game, and you can also purchase custom skins and clothes from the Marketplace.

![Customizing Character in Bedrock edition](https://cdn.erikaheidi.com/minecraft/03-character.png)

On Java edition, you need to access your profile in the Minecraft website, and access the menu "Change Skin" in the *Minecraft: Java Edition* section. In this menu, you can upload custom skins in PNG format. You can find a [large collection of downloadable skins in this website](https://www.minecraftskins.com/).

### Creating an Offline World

The best starting point to get acquainted with the gameplay and controls is by creating a new offline world that can serve as your sandbox.

### Joining a Realm

If you have an invitation for a Realm, or if you have subscribed to Realms, you can play online with friends by joining the Realm.

![Joining a Realm](https://cdn.erikaheidi.com/minecraft/05-realms.png)

### Basic Controls

When playing on a computer, you can move with the keys **a**, **w**, **s**, **d**. Left mouse click will mine or hit an object, while right mouse click is for interacting (for instance, in the craft table). Moving the mouse moves the camera. To drop an item, use the **q** key. The inventory is available with the **e** key.

When playing on a console, the main action button will be for mining and hitting, while the second action button will be for interacting with items. Left stick for moving, right stick for moving the camera view.

You'll be working a lot with your inventory and in your craft table. Use the search feature to search for recipes when you want to craft something specific. New recipes will unlock as you discover new materials.

### The Minecraft World

As worlds are randomly generated, your spawn place (or the place where you'll land when you join the game) is typically determined at random, and you can end up in any of the available [biomes](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Biome) depending on how your world map was generated. Minecraft biomes separate worlds into different environments, such as desert, mountains, beach, forest, and more. Each biome has its own geographical features and resources. If you are not satisfied with where you landed, you can always migrate to another area. Just keep moving in the same direction, and you'll definitely find a different biome where you can live.

When you sleep in a bed, a new spawn place is set, so you will always return to your "new home". If you migrate, make sure to find a spot where you can craft a bed so you don't go back to the original spawn location in case you die or leave the game.

## Things to be Aware - Top Tips

* You can mine some things with your bare hands, but you'll typically need a tool that is right for the job in order to be efficient.
* **Pickaxes** are for mining stone. For wood, you'll need an **axe**. For dirt / soil you'll need a **shovel**.
* Some materials require a stronger tool to be mined. For instance, you'll need an iron pickaxe for mining gold and redstone.
* You can get hurt if you fall from a high, so be careful when going down.
* When digging down, be careful to not just dig straight down, create a staircase so you can climb back up.
* Many mobs are neutral and will only attack if you attack first. Hostile mobs will always attack.
* Always have torches if you're mining down and going into caves. It's very dark down there\!
* It's good to carry an extra craft table that you can deploy when needed, for instance when you're in a cave and your pickaxe breaks.
* If you're unsure where to build your house, try to find a [village](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Village). Each biome has a slightly different type of village, and they will have resources such as food plantations and you can also trade with villagers.

## 10 Steps in a new Minecraft World

This is a suggested roadmap of 10 initial goals to get acquainted with Minecraft and get settled in your new world.

1. Find a good spot to build your house
    1. Look at material sources nearby
2. Collect some wood
3. Build a crafting table
4. Craft wood tools
5. Mine stone
6. Craft stone tools
7. Build a house to protect you from the rain
    1. You can use stone and wood blocks
    2. Craft a wooden chest to save your stuff
8. Craft a furnace so you can smelt iron and other materials
9. Keep mining to find new materials and recipes
    1. Find **coal** to build torches so you can dig deeper in the mountains
    2. Find **iron** so that you can craft scissors to cut off wool from sheep (then you'll be able to craft a bed)
    3. Find **sand** to craft glass blocks that you can use as windows
10. Build a fun rail system to move along your village
    1. Collect more **iron** to build rails and a rail cart
    2. Find **gold** to build activated rails
    3. Find **redstone** to move a rail cart through rails

**Tip:** gold and redstone can usually be found very deep in caves. You'll need to craft an **iron pickaxe** in order to mine these materials.
